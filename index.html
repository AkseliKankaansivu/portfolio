            <p>
                Hello! My name is Akseli and I'm studying IT in Jyväskylä University. This is my website-portfolio
                and I'll tell you about my skills specifically in this field. I've yet to experience coding for an actual company
                but I'm itching to get my career started. I'm really interested in front-end web development.

        <p>
            I have gained most of my IT-skills from my studies, but computers are a big part of my freetime as well. I'm most familiar C#, Java, Javascript and CSS. I know 
            the basics of Haskell, C++ and SQL. I'm familiar with OOP and I have made a lot of UML-diagrams. I know the steps and the process of
            system development and project management (Scrum, waterfall). I have been an essential part in our group projects.

        <p>User interface prototype for a shopping list application made with Java and JavaFX. It's a project made for school

            <li>Adding/deleting products and shops</li>
            <li>Editing shop names</li>

        <h3>GAME PROJECT WILL BE UPLOADED TO THE PORTFOLIO LATER. It's a shooting game where the player
            is at the bottom of the screen and enemies come towards the bottom of the screen like in space invaders. The game 
            was made with C# using Jypeli-library.
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shooting enemies and getting points from them</li>
            <li>Enemies and player have simple animations</li>
            <li>You have health, the game is over when the player runs out of health</li>
